                            and
                            computer networking. I have several years of professional experience in IT operations. Most
                            recently,
                            I've established a skillset in software development. Specifically, I have a strong
                            background in
                            C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. My career goals include working as a Full Stack
                            Software
                            Developer. In the future, I'd like to leverage my experience in IT Operations as a Systems
                            and Network
                            Administrator to work in the field of DevOps.

                                    <p>
                                        As Novelty's Network Administrator, I have worked to ensure that the company's
                                        computer networks, systems, and line of business applications are accessible and
                                        working as optimally as possible. Aside from my typical duties, I've taken on
                                        several
                                        projects to further my own skills and create improvements for my employer. One
                                        in
                                        particular achievement is the implementation of a Remote Management Suite. When
                                        I
                                        arrived at Novelty, end-user and server security patch management was at around
                                        18%
                                        compliance. With the implementation of our RMM software, I was able to get patch
                                        management to 94% compliance. I also was able to implement OS imaging and
                                        deployment standards through our RMM, while previously this was done manually.
                                        This
                                        has led to a 250% increase in deployment times. I also spearheaded the
                                        development
                                        and deployment of the company's TurboBlueTorches website, which I still maintain
                                        today.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        While at BlackInk IT I was able to learn enough on the job to earn several IT
                                        certifications from industry vendors. Aside from this, I was able to create
                                        several
                                        initiatives to improve system deployment times by evaluating and making
                                        recommendations
                                        to the processes and procedures of these assignments. This led to a substantial
                                        increase
                                        in the deployment time of systems.

                                        I also worked to remediate and fix the company's website due to a Wordpress
                                        vulnerability.
                                        I provided several updates to fix broken themes and continue to harden and
                                        secure the
                                        company website to prevent future security breaches.

                                    <p>
                                        While at Momentum for Mental Health I spent extensive time learning the process
                                        and procedures
                                        involved in IT support and operations. I was able to spend a large amount of
                                        time working directly
                                        with the company's network administrator to obtain a strong foundation in
                                        configuring, supporting,
                                        and upgrading a Windows Server environment. I also was able to spend a large
                                        amount of time working
                                        on upgrade projects related to the company's data center. This included rewiring
                                        and configuring
                                        switches, firewall, UPS, and other hardware. In my role as Help Desk Technician,
                                        I learned the
                                        importance in data critical thinking, data collection, and working with others
                                        in sometimes stressful
                                        situations. I was able to work with over 500 end users and reduce overall
                                        escalation of issues to

                                        As a Systems Technician I was able to work in an unsupervised capacity on
                                        several of our client sites
                                        that I interned on as a student at the Stride Center. I also played a critical
                                        part in working to
                                        upgrade the school's computer systems and school migration to Office 365 and
                                        Microsoft Teams. I also
                                        spent time working with students who were preparing to take their CompTIA A+
                                        exams as a menthor.

                                        As an advanced-student at The Stride Center, I was approved to join my
                                        instructor as a paid intern
                                        to work fulltime as an IT Support Intern. I assisted my instructor and other
                                        Stride instructors at
                                        many of the 77-client locations in the San Francisco Bay Area providing
                                        remediation, installation, and
                                        changes to various systems and networking equipment. I was able to utilize
                                        concepts learned from my time
                                        as a student at The Stride Center in a live working environment.
