                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>I am an IT professional with extensive experience in computer networking, cybersecurity,
                            systems administration, software and web development. I like to tell people that I never
                            feel like I go in to work because I do what I love every day. I can honestly say that there
                            are few things in this world as great as living each day doing something that you're
                            passionate about and I feel blessed knowing that's exactly the outlook I have on the career
                            I've chosen.
                            <br><br>
                            You could say that my career in IT began as a kid. Like many others I started playing video
                            games and that’s a passion that I’ve never lost. In fact, it was the reason I chose to
                            create this Discord-inspired portfolio. Gaming has defined me as a person, and I expect
                            that’s a fair assessment of many individuals in this industry. Sometime around my 15th
                            birthday, my dad and I took a used computer I had bought apart. I remember going to Fry’s
                            electronics and buying some replacement thermal paste and a new hard drive and additional
                            RAM. I believe this is what really sparked my interest in IT but I didn’t realize it then.
                            <br><br>
                            It would take several more years and a few blue-collar jobs to realize that I wanted to work
                            with my brains and not my brawns. I have a huge respect for people who work physically
                            demanding jobs. But there’s a certain enjoyment I get from a real mental challenge. And so,
                            I went back to school. I really wanted to get into software development. I did a few
                            programming courses (primarily C#) but at this point in my life, I also didn’t want to spend
                            3 more years earning a degree in software development. So, I fast tracked a degree in
                            cybersecurity in a shorter manner of time by also taking CompTIA and Microsoft training
                            courses at night for certifications and college credit. In short time, I started working as
                            an IT Systems Technician for the training center I was attending. After graduation I took a
                            job as a Help Desk Technician for a medical organization in San Jose.
                            <br><br>
                            Eventually my wife was offered a position in our home state of Indiana and I decided it was
                            time to return to Indiana. I took a job as a systems technician for a Managed Service
                            Provider. I loved the work and got to meet a lot of wonderful people in the area. I
                            continued earning certifications and it wasn’t long before I started getting offers for
                            systems administrator and network administrator positions. I ended up taking a position as a
                            network administrator for a sales company, where I’m still at today.
                            <br><br>
                            As time has passed, I’ve noticed that even in my capacity as a network administrator, I’m
                            always looking for ways to write scripts and automate tasks. In short time, I started
                            researching software development bootcamps. I came across Eleven Fifty Academy, and that is
                            where I’m at now. I’m currently finishing my gold badge while working fulltime. I love
                            infrastructure, cybersecurity, networking, and IT service management. But I especially enjoy
                            creating software to solve problems. It’s my hope to eventually move into a DevOps position
                            and utilize my refined skills in software development alongside network administration
                            skills and experience.

                                            fundamentals of C#, HTML, and CSS has given me the ability to devote my time
